I was told why I saw two charges on my account because they put a pin on my account for the cost. I don’t get that because then when they took the charge now I am overdrawn 86 dollars.

Because I spent $100 on them, she still has to wear them. When I called Nike to try and make it right, they said it was because they probably got wet and they didn't consider it a defect.

I explained this to Karol (the Nike.com CSR) and she said that \"I was checking here, and you are right. It seems the order has a label created, but it hasn't shipped yet.\" Karol also said that \"It's scanned, and at the warehouse. I just refunded you the extra shipping.

Not sure about other people but after this experience I am not happy with a voucher. I won't name any other company but had an issue with work boots with a different company they asked for pictures and within 1 week I have a new pair at my front door, now that's a company that stands behind their product.

Earlier i have used ON whey and the difference on the digestive front is very evidentMB bioenzyme is super digestible for me ( no diarrhoea, protein farts and such), i take this with milk and yet there are no digestive issues probably because of the enzymes claimed to exist in the product. The flavour is awesome, tastes like a dessert when blended with milk. overall i like the taste, digestibility but i am not in a position to certify the macros claimed (it's sweet so 2g carb seems a little far fetched)Since I take this as a part of a varied diet( not for bodybuilding but only to include more proteins in Indian diet), i cannot comment on effectiveness for muscle building\",\n",
